<!-- This comment is for me in case I forget how to use github. I have never used it before -->
<!-- First open the CMD and navigate to this file location using cd for change directory -->
<!-- Second always do a git pull at the start of the day. Even though this is my document -->
<!-- it is still something that I will do so I don't forget. -->
<!-- Third when I want to add the changes I made in git from a file type: get add -A -->
<!-- Then type: git commit -m "The comment that goes along with it" -->
<!-- Periodically do this throughout the day -->
<!-- Also after git add use the git commit and push-->
